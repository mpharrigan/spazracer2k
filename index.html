        <p class="lead">In middle school I made a game with my friends. Now for the first time &ndash; available via the
          web &ndash; <strong>spazracer 2000</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Directions: </strong> Explode the enemy boxes by running into them. Use the arrow keys to move. Time
          doesn't start until you move.
          Look out for the power cube! Can't live without it. We highly recommend sound be turned on!
          Compete with your friends for that ellusive high score. Don't fall off the edge (or do... It's not that big a
          deal)
        </p>

      <h3><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h3>
      <h4>The collision detection isn't very good</h4>
      <p>You're goddam right it isn't</p>

      <h4>The performance isn't good. It's lagging!</h4>
      <p>Maybe javascript wasn't the best idea for this.</p>
